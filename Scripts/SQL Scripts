# UEFA SQL Data Analysis Project

This project involves analyzing UEFA football data using SQL to solve real-world analytical questions related to goals, matches, players, teams, and stadiums.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To perform structured data analysis using SQL by solving 55 business-oriented questions across multiple datasets.

---

## 📂 Dataset Description

The project uses 5 datasets:

* Goals → Goal details (player, assist, match, time)
* Matches → Match results, teams, attendance
* Players → Player details (age, position, nationality)
* Teams → Team and country information
* Stadiums → Stadium location and capacity

---

## 🧠 Problem Categories Solved

### ⚽ Goal Analysis

* Identified top goal scorers per season
* Calculated total and average goals
* Found players with most assists
* Analyzed goals per match and stadium

---

### 🏟 Match Analysis

* Highest scoring matches
* Draw matches count
* Team performance (home & away)
* Attendance and stadium usage

---

### 👤 Player Analysis

* Top performing players
* Goals + assists contribution
* Player statistics (age, height, position)
* Players with no goals

---

### 🏆 Team Analysis

* Teams with highest goals
* Home wins and performance
* Teams by country and stadium

---

### 🏟 Stadium Analysis

* Highest capacity stadiums
* Match distribution by stadium
* Attendance and capacity insights

---

### 🔗 Cross Table Analysis

* Combined multiple tables using JOINs
* Player performance by stadium
* Team performance in high-attendance matches
* Goal distribution across conditions

---

### 🔥 Complex Queries

* Goal analysis in first 30 minutes
* Score difference analysis
* High goal difference matches
* Goals per match ratio

---

## 💻 SQL Concepts Used

* SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY
* GROUP BY, HAVING
* Aggregate Functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG)
* JOINs (INNER, LEFT)
* Subqueries
* Complex filtering

---

## 📁 Project Files
